# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

While I was never trying to be fast with these problems, I was usually trying to do them before the working day starts (they are published at 7AM here), to make sure I don't hear a solution mentioned during the day. The code quality isn't my best, but it should be at least somewhat readable.

I don't mind using sub-optimal approaches, as long as they don't take way too long to run. I'm happy to get the right answer without devoting all day to it. A couple of problems run for over a minute, but work reliably.

In the earlier days, I tried to mix up the programming languages a little. I mostly use Python, but also tried some Ruby (I worked with Ruby on Rails for a few years) and NodeJS (it's hard to avoid this at work). As the month progressed, I started trying to choose the right tool for the problem, which often meant Python.

Later in the month, I started using more object-oriented approaches to make the code a little easier to debug. This added some overhead, but I think it worked out well in the end.

I avoided extra libraries, but I did often refer to my notes from an algorithms course on several days, opting to create things using examples written in pseudocode. I did not use any LLMs or similar tools, beyond the basic autocomplete built into my text editor.

A few puzzles needed more thought, so starting around day 14, I swapped to working on them in the evening, and days 17, 20 and 21 were completed several days after they were published. On the especially challenging puzzles, I've added a tiny README.md file which notes how I did it, especially if this isn't clear from the code.
